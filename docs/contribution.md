# Contributing

- Just like any other open source project contributions are always welcome. If you have
any ideas whatsoever, just file an issue on Github, and we can discuss if it makes sense
to implement it.
- Since a large part of this project depends more on
[amlb](https://github.com/openml/automlbenchmark), in all
  honesty, it makes sense to focus contributions there more than this particular library.
